Caspar Graphics is a tool for building, testing and packaging HTML graphics for CasparCG using code. We created Caspar Graphics to make it easier for ourselves to build and maintain graphic packages. It offers a number of key benefits for people looking to create graphics efficiently and effectively:

Scaffolding a new project is super fast and you'll be up and running in just a matter of seconds.

- A simple and intuitive UI makes it easy to interact with your graphics — send data updates, play and stop animations, and view all of your graphics together to make sure they're positioned properly.
- No configuration is needed with out-of-the-box support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS and more.
- Lightning Fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement) enables you to quickly see your changes as they're made.
- Connect to a CasparCG server to easily test your graphics in a production environment.
- Package your graphics into an optimized bundle, ready to be played in CasparCG.

We've built Caspar Graphics on top of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which offers fast and reliable performance with no need for configuration. This means that you can benefit from most of those features as well.
