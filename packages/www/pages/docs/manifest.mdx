# Manifest

Each graphic template is defined by two files â€” `index.html` and `manifest.json`. Both these files should be placed in the template's root folder. 
The `index.html` is used as the entry point for the actual template, while `manifest.json` is used to describe the template. 

## `name: string`

The user-facing name of the template.

## `width: number`

The template's fixed width in pixels. Leave empty if this should be dynamic.

## `height: number`

The template's fixed height pixels. Leave empty if this should be dynamic.

## `schema: object`

Describes the data that the template expects to receive (via updates). 
Each data property is defined by a key/value pair, where the key is the name of the field, and the value describes it.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "schema": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "label": "Text"
    },
    "title": {
      "type": "string",
      "label": "Text"
    },
    "fontSize": {
      "type": "number",
      "label": "Font Size"
    }
  }
}
````

This schema accepts three fields: `name`, `title` and `fontSize`. 

## `previewData: object`

Defines sets of data used to preview the graphic. This is only meant as help when developing the graphic and isn't used in production. See [Preview Presets](/docs/preview-presets) for more information.

## `previewImages: array`

A list of images to use when developing the graphic. This is only meant as help when developing the graphic and isn't used in production. See [Preview Images](/docs/preview-images) for more information.
