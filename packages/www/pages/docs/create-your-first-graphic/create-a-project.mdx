# Create a Project

Start by [creating a new](/docs/getting-started#create-a-new-project) project called `my-graphics` (or a name of your choice):

```bash
  npm create caspar-graphics@latest my-graphics --template react
```

This will give you a `templates` folder containing another folder called `example`:

```
my-graphics
└── templates
    └── example
        └── index.html
        └── index.jsx
        └── manifest.json
```

Open `my-graphics` in your editor of choice and [start the development server](/docs/getting-started#run-the-development-server). You should now see this in your browser:

![React Example](/react-example-1.jpg)

In the sidebar on the left you can see that a graphic called "React Example" has been picked up by the server. 

### Change the Name
Let's start by changing its name by opening up `manifest.json` and change the property `name` to `"Lowerthird"`.

```json filename="my-graphics/templates/example/manifest.json" {2}
{
  "name": "Lowerthird",
  "width": 1920,
  "height": 1080,
  "schema": {},
  "previewData": {}
}
```

Now if you save and reload the page you should see the graphic has been renamed.
